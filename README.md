## Workflow :memo:

Our general DEV workflow should be the next:

1. Find a task that has a score and you feel confortable developing.<br />
2. Make sure all the info you need to develop it is available to you, if not ask the team.<br />
3. Assign the task to yourself and set it on the "To do" or "Doing" columns depending on when you will actually start.<br />
4. Create a new branch from `develop` using this naming convention:<br />
`feature/description` for additions<br />
`bugfix/description` for bugfixes<br />
`enhancement/description` for improvements<br />
`issue/description` for issues<br />
5. Code :D<br />
6. Commit your changes.<br />
7. If your task is ready submit a pull request on Github.

**Pull request should always:**
- Have pictures or screenshots if it has visuals in it.
- Have a link to the trello task related to it.

**Notes:**
- All PRs should be named like their branch
**- All code should be properly documented, refer to the documentation and comments sections of the style guides.**
- all PRs need at-least 2 approvals from the team to be merged to develop.
- Your submissions should have commits that are clear and have intent, don't  add a commit if it is not needed, but avoid vague commits.
- If you feel your code needs more than one commit to keep it clear and organized, please do it.
- If someone ask questions on your PR, that doesn't mean they think you are wrong or are attacking you.
- Ask ALL the questions you need through out the process, the team is here for you.
